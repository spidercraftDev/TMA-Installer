## Building
- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- Install pnpm globally `npm i -g pnpm`
- Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
- You can then run `pnpm tauri dev` or `pnpm tauri build`


⚠️ Please note that the installer is open source but the updater logic is still here.
